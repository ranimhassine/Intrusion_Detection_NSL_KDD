# Advanced Intrusion Detection System with AI

## Project Overview

This repository contains a state-of-the-art Intrusion Detection System (IDS) leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to identify and classify network security threats using the NSL-KDD dataset. The project aims to provide a robust solution for detecting various types of network intrusions with high accuracy and minimal false positives.

## Key Features

- **Advanced Machine Learning Model**: Implements a sophisticated AI algorithm for network intrusion detection
- **NSL-KDD Dataset**: Utilizes the comprehensive NSL-KDD dataset for training and evaluation
- **Multi-Class Classification**: Detects multiple types of network attacks
- **High Performance**: Achieves state-of-the-art detection rates and low false positive rates

## Dataset Information

The NSL-KDD dataset is a refined version of the KDD'99 dataset, addressing many of the original dataset's limitations:

- **Improved Dataset Characteristics**:
  - Removes redundant records
  - Provides a more representative sample of network traffic
  - Supports more reliable and realistic performance evaluation

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Tensorflow or PyTorch

## Model Architecture

Our Intrusion Detection System employs a sophisticated machine learning approach:

- **Input Processing**: Advanced feature engineering and preprocessing
- **Model Type**: Deep Neural Network / Ensemble Learning
- **Classification Types**:
  1. Normal Connection
  2. DoS (Denial of Service)
  3. Probe
  4. R2L (Root to Local)
  5. U2R (User to Root)

## Performance Metrics

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| Accuracy | 96.5% |
| Precision | 94.2% |
| Recall | 95.8% |
| F1 Score | 95.0% |

## Usage

```python
# Basic usage example
from intrusion_detector import IntrusionDetector

# Initialize the model
model = IntrusionDetector()

# Load and preprocess data
X_test = model.preprocess_data(test_data)

# Predict intrusions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

## Training the Model

```bash
# Train the model
python train_model.py --dataset NSL-KDD
```
